# Behavior

## Scratching

Cats *need* to scratch. “Declawing” is removal of their toes at the first knuckle, which is a barbaric surgery. The best thing to do when cats are hunting or clawing the wrong things is to continue providing alternatives until you find some things they prefer. For example, we keep corrugated cardboard scratchers around the house and a few sisal towers at strategic locations.

## Vomit

Cats may eat too fast and throw up. they also develop hairballs over time from grooming. Consider scotch guarding your rugs and keeping a jug of Nature’s Miracle Stain and Odor remover and a spray bottle to refill. <https://www.amazon.com/Natures-Miracle-Stain-Odor-Remover/dp/B072FVZ1Z9/>. 

For eating too fast you can try a "puzzle feeder" which slows down their ability to gulp down food. For hairballs you can brush them regularly, such as once a week. This will keep them happy and healthy. Brushing regularly is a nice ritual that will keep your carpets clean and your bond with your cats stronger.

## Bathroom problems

If cats are peeing or pooping where they shouldn’t then they don’t like the box or have a health problem. Time to visit the vet.

# Litter

## Our Litter Setup

* We have the litter in the garage and a cat door cut into the door to the house with a closable flap for when we need to open up the garage.
* We use storage totes with a cut out. They make cheap nice large boxes. Try to cut and sand so there aren’t any sharp edges. Try to find a tote that doesn’t have a lot of bends and reinforcement at the base that will make scooping more difficult. Rounded square inner edges are best. These actually tend to be cheaper than the reinforced style molds.
* The totes sit on a horse stall mat from Tractor Supply. The open box is now another tote. It used to be an open box and the tray underneath is a clothes washer drain tray. 
* I keep a shop vac next to the litter and a galvanized metal can with a feed scoop for topping off the litter.
* We’ve had older cats that had trouble and would sometimes pee outside the box. There’s a horse stall product called Sweet PDZ that can soak it up and eliminate the ammonia smell. Then you can just vacuum it up. 
* We use Dr. Elsey’s Ultra Clumping cat litter.
* For outdoor cats we keep HEB food in a container called a Vittle Vault. It’s a very good food safe container.

## A More Modest Setup

The [Litter Genie litter box](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FDHBM5N/) is basic and an excellent design. Some reviewers report cracks around the handles after some time or even upon arrival. For small cracks near edges or handles you can use a lighter to reflow the flexible plastic. This will seal the crack and prevent it from spreading. 

You can also [add a litter mat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L8KGJZL/). This will catch a lot of tracked litter. You can vacuum them or hose them down and dry them outside.

# Food

For kittens our go-to food is IAMs proactive healthy kitten <https://www.iams.com/cat/cat-food/buy/iams-proactive-health-healthy-kitten>

For indoor adult cats we mostly use Purina Indoor Advantage <https://www.purina.com/purina-one/cats/dry-cat-food/indoor-cat-food>. 

For outdoor cats and as a morning treat for our boys we use HEB Adult Complete <https://www.heb.com/product-detail/h-e-b-texas-pets-adult-complete-formula-dry-cat-food/1910808>

# Toys/Scratchers

The turbo scratcher is a very old toy and every cat seems to like it more or less. You can find it on sale, get refills etc. <https://www.amazon.com/Bergan-70128-Scratcher-Assorted-Colors/dp/B00O8PTF36/>

Another great scratcher is The Ultimate Scratching post. They like to stretch when they scratch and love this thing. <https://www.amazon.com/SmartCat-3832-Ultimate-Scratching-Post/dp/B000634MH8/>

Cats will mark the corners of your walls and leave a dark residue. You can keep cleaning it off or give them this and they’ll use it to mark / groom. <https://www.amazon.com/Catit-Senses-2-0-Self-Groomer/dp/B00D3NI2PG/>

When a cat goes after a rug or a bed we place a cheap corrugated scratcher nearby and put some catnip on it. Praise them for using the right stuff <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MZG54L6>

These scratchers are basically furniture and take up a good amount of space but they last virtually forever. We’ve had them for years.

There’s a type of cat toy usually called a “kicker”. They like to hug and kick stuff with their back feet. This is \_by far\_ the most popular I’ve ever had. Cats love this thing. Every person I’ve told about it got one and has rave reviews. <https://www.chewy.com/yeowww-catnip-yellow-banana-cat-toy/dp/130257>

Cats really like milk jug rings. They slide and they can carry them around. The boys we’ve had and fostered tend to like these. They are like a milk jug ring formed into a ball <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07715HDHZ>. That Jackson Galaxy brand / guy makes a lot of neat innovative toys. He’s kind of a “cat whisperer” celebrity.

We got this box of toy mice to have random toys around the house to distract. Also useful if they are doing something and you are busy. You can keep some of these at your desk and throw em. <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DNVFRC4>

Sticky Paws is a good product to protect furniture. It’s easy to apply and won’t leave anything behind <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007I08FI4/>

# Grooming

If you start early you can teach them to let you trim nails. I’ve found the scissor style works better than the guillotine ones that tend to crush their nails. Be careful not to hit the “quick” or it’ll set you back trust-wise. <https://www.amazon.com/Pet-Republique-Professional-Nail-Clippers/dp/B01GBSSKVU/>

They are often less skeptical of grooming gloves and the Magic Coat ones are the best <https://www.amazon.com/Four-Paws-Magic-Glove-Brush/dp/B002USK6X6/>

Cats get a thicker coat a couple times a year then shed it. There’s an “undercoat” that can take longer but if you want to go deeper with shedding issues this is the best tool <https://www.amazon.com/Furminator-Cat-Short-Hair-Large/dp/B07L13WQR3/>

After we brush we wipe them down with these mild dander wipes. I’m allergic to cats so these help a lot. We also vacuum the entire house every week. <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CCV8GUA/>

# Beds

Lots of blankets and throws on furniture. During the winter we put a heated blanket on the master bed for the cats. We got this one recently. It doesn’t get super hot and they like it even if it’s not plugged in. <https://www.amazon.com/Pet-Products-Thermo-Mod-Dream-Heated/dp/B07PH45VYC/>
