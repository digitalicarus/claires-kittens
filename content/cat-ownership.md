# Behavior

## Scratching

Cats *need* to scratch. “Declawing” is removal of their toes at the first knuckle, which is a barbaric surgery. The best thing to do when cats are hunting or clawing the wrong things is to continue providing alternatives until you find things they prefer. For example, we keep corrugated cardboard scratchers around the house and a few sisal towers at strategic locations.

## Catcidents

Accidents happen from time to time: hairballs, etc. Consider scotch guarding your rugs and keeping a jug of Nature’s Miracle Stain and Odor remover and a spray bottle to refill. <https://www.amazon.com/Natures-Miracle-Stain-Odor-Remover/dp/B072FVZ1Z9/>. 

If they eat too fast you can try a "puzzle feeder" which slows down their ability to gulp down food. For hairballs you can brush them regularly, such as once a week. This will keep them happy and healthy. Brushing regularly is a nice ritual that will keep your carpets clean and keep your bond with your cats stronger.

## Bathroom issues

If they ever use the bathroom where they shouldn’t then they either don’t like the box, it's location, it's cleanliness, or they have a health problem. If you can't figure it out it's time to visit the vet.

## Keeping things clean and comfy

Cats are social. They love routine. Playing, eating, and getting up in the morning to make coffee at the same times are both soothing and exciting. The predictability lets them anticipate and plan. It's low stress. They also love clean carpets and beds. We keep a lot of soft, easily-washable blankets and throws on furniture for protection and comfort. 

Scoop the litter box *every day*. No exceptions. It's better for everybody.

Don't leave out wet food, they'll get sick just like you would if you eat meat that's left out too long. Don't leave out dry food, it gets stale.
