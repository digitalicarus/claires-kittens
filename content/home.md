    description: Gremlin is a little chonker with short legs and glorious tufts of

    description: Nip is adventurous and wise. He has a subtle bit of white hair
      between his eyes. He nipped the vet once but to be fair she put her finger
      in his mouth.

    description: Girl is actually a boy but has pink lips and is very gentle. We
      suspected if anyone in the litter was a girl it was Girl.

Claire is a kitten herself at near or under 1 year old! 

She was frolicking near our home in late Spring 2022. She wasn't doing so well and had some skin problems from flea allergies. Also, it was about to be over 100 degrees outside as the summer set in. We took her to the vet and found out she was about halfway into her pregnancy. We took her in and began caring for her. Claire couldn't receive antibiotics or vaccines due to the pregnancy. With calm and care eventually her coat became shiny and her skin issues cleared up. We were able to get her completely healthy and comfortable weeks before the kittens finally arrived. 

We intend to be Claire's forever home. She's very compatible with our 5 other cats ðŸ˜Š 

All the kittens were born without a hitch and Claire's motherly instincts sprung into action. She's been a model mom. She even learned to open doors to encourage them to explore ðŸ˜…

All the kittens are super well adjusted and very socialized. They are happy, healthy, playful, and intelligent. Also, **all the kittens are boys**.

Ideally, we will find homes were they can be adopted in pairs or groups. Having litter mates as pets is incredibly rewarding. The bond they form is unlike any other. They take incredible care of each other.
