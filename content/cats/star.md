  Now Girl has a new home and a new name, Star! Star was adopted with Cosmo
  (Nip) so they have each other. We are so happy when litter mates get to stick
  together ðŸ¥°


  Originally named Girl. Girl is actually a boy but has pink lips and is very gentle. We suspected if anyone in the litter was a girl it was Girl.
